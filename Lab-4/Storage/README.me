Azure Storage
In this lab, I learned how to use Azure Storage.
I created a storage account, made a blob container, uploaded a file, and used a SAS link to open the file.
1. Creating the Storage Account

I opened the Azure Portal and created a new storage account.
I used these basic settings:

Resource group: cloud-lab-rg

Region: Central India

Type: Standard

Redundancy: LRS

After filling the details, I clicked Create.
2. Creating a Blob Container

Inside the storage account, I went to Containers and created a new one.

Container name: lab3container

Access level: Private
3. Uploading a File

I opened the container and uploaded a test file (example: “lab3-output.txt”).
The upload worked without any issue.
4. Creating a SAS Link

I clicked on the uploaded file and selected Generate SAS.
I allowed only Read permission and set an expiry time.
Then I copied the generated SAS URL.
5. Testing the SAS Link

I tested the SAS link in two ways:

In browser:

The file opened successfully.

From my VM:

I ran this command:                       curl -I " sas link " and then i got like output HTTP/1.1 200 OK.
